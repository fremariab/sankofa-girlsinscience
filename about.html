                        <h2>A Spark in 2010</h2>
                        <p>
                            In July 2010, telecom executive <strong>Nana Beecham</strong> returned home to Ghana, inspired by her experiences in the Fortune/U.S. State Department Women's Mentoring Partnership. 
                            While being mentored at <strong>Xerox</strong> in Rochester, New York, she met the <strong>Black Women's Leadership Council (BWLC)</strong>. 
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            The BWLC had a dream: to light a spark in African girls studying science. Nana’s answer was an immediate "Yes." 
                            She chose her hometown of <strong>Breman Asikuma</strong> as the starting point, specifically Breman Asikuma Senior High School (BASHS), 
                            to honor her parents' legacy and the gift of education that transformed their lives.
